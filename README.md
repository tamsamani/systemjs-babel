SystemJS Babel Extension
===

Supports loading TypeScript for `.ts` and ES modules for `.js` files natively in the browser for _easy development workflows_.

Builds on top of the [fetch hook](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/blob/master/docs/hooks.md#fetchurl---promise) in SystemJS supported by both the `system.js` and `s.js` builds.

The source transform is skipped for all `System.register` sources, thereby allowing interop of System modules, ES modules and TypeScript.

Specifically does not provide configuration hooks, because no type checking is performed and this is designed to handle current syntax only.

_If a syntax or feature is supported in any browser, it should be supported here but polyfills are a non-goal. Feature requests and PRs welcome to improve support._

## Notes

> this is a forked repo from the original repo [systemjs/systemjs-babel](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs-babel) 
> the propose for this fork is testing extending babel configuration via SystemJS core.

#### Why? What's!

I have forked this repo only for make a costumization/configuration the systemjs babelOptions. because I get limited when trying developing using `systemjs` in browser transformation develeopment.

## Usage

```
npm install systemjs-babel
```

```html
<script src="systemjs/dist/s.js"></script>
<script src="dist/systemjs-babel.js"></script>
<script>
  // TypeScript modules supported with ".ts" extension
   System.import('./ts-module.ts');
  
  // ES modules
  System.import('./es-module.js');
</script>
```

_Explicit file extensions are required for loading dependencies. For TypeScript this means including the `.ts` extension for relative dependency imports just like Deno._

Bare specifiers are mapped with [import maps](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/blob/master/docs/import-maps.md), so file extensions remain optional.

**Not Suitable for Production Workflows**
